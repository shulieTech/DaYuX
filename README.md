# DaYuX
DaYuX is an Java-based open-source system designed to measure online performance and load test applications, Especially for microservices.

大禹X是一款基于Java的开源系统，用于实现生产环境的性能测试，尤其是面向微服务架构系统。

# Why should we do online environmental performance test
Microservices Architecture is used commonly nowadays and it always make system complex to understand for humans. Moreover, businesses are also very complex in huge system. Business complexity and system complexity make it difficult to Keep entire system highly available and Maintain Research & Development efficiency. 
Performance test on test environment which is very different from online environment can not guarantee system performance.

**Microservices Are Complex**<br/>
Compare with monolithic application, Microservices architecture increases complexity for business system. It may maintain multiple tools and frameworks.

**Business Systems Are Complex**
Businesses involve different sections and many of them are long-process and complicated, such as E-Commerce businesses.

**The Microservices Relation Is Complex**
In a microservices architecture system with a lot of business services, the calling relation between services is very complicated. Every change may affect the availability of the entire system and make developers difficult to release new versions Frequently.
